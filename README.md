In this project, we are building a mobile application for booking sports stadiums that 
aims to facilitate the process of booking different sports stadiums, allowing the selection 
of the preferred stadium, advanced search and filtering, while providing a secure epayment feature. The application allows stadium owners to manage reservations and 
thus improve the efficiency of stadium use. The application provides advanced features 
to control booking details, match duration, number of players, player selection, as well 
as club and team selection. Through the application, you can submit requests to join a 
specific team or join multiple leagues. The application provides a separate platform for 
managing stadiums as facilities (such as adding a stadium and detailed information 
about the stadium), as well as managing reservations for each stadium and providing 
statistical information that enriches the experience of the sports facility owner, 
improves the efficiency of using stadiums, and helps provide interesting offers to 
players and owners of sports facilities. 
The sports stadium booking application offers a comprehensive platform designed to 
facilitate stadium booking, make the booking process smoother, and enhance the overall 
experience for users, stadium managers, and system administrators. The platform is 
user-friendly and feature-rich to simplify the stadium booking process, encourage 
community engagement, and provide valuable insights for stadium owners and sports 
clubs.
